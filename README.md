Hi World!

I'm planning to become a full stack programmer in the future. At first i want to start with the Python language and then continue with Javascript, HTML and CSS (front end) and then finally make a leap into back end languages. I really hope this works out as my future and happiness depends on it :).

Discipline is all!!!
